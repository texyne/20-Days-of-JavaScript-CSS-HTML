# CSS Glowing Icons

This project demonstrates the use of advanced CSS techniques to create glowing icons with animation effects. It showcases the potential of CSS3 animations and the use of the Font Awesome library to enhance user interface elements.

## Features

- **CSS Reset**: A CSS reset is applied to ensure consistency across different browsers by setting the default margin and padding of all elements to zero.
- **Viewport Height and Width**: The body of the document is set to take up the full viewport height and width, with a solid background color.
- **Flexbox Container**: A `.container` class is defined to use CSS flexbox properties to center its children horizontally and vertically.
- **Icon Styling**: Large font sizes are applied to icons from the Font Awesome library, along with custom background colors, shadows, and animations to create a glowing effect.
- **Hue-Rotate Animation**: Keyframe animations are used to apply a rotating hue filter to the icons, creating a continuous color-changing effect.
- **Font Awesome Integration**: Icons are included using the Font Awesome library, which is loaded from a CDN.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document containing the structure and links to the CSS stylesheets and Font Awesome library.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet defining the styles for the glowing icons animation.

## Icon List

- Apple (`#apple`): Displays a glowing Apple icon.
- Twitter (`#twitter`): Displays a glowing Twitter icon with a slight animation delay to create a staggered effect.
- GitHub (`#github`): Displays a glowing GitHub icon with its own animation delay.
- Facebook (`#facebook`): Displays a glowing Facebook icon, also with an animation delay.

## Animations

The icons are animated using a `@keyframes` rule that changes the `hue-rotate` filter from `0deg` to `360deg`, creating a visually appealing effect that cycles through different colors.

## Usage

To view the animation, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
